                <p>
                •	An IDO is a fundraising method in which the token is issued via a decentralized liquidity exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                •	A decentralized liquidity exchange is a type of crypto asset exchange that relies on liquidity pools with which traders can swap tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                •	Liquidity pools are pairs of crypto assets and stable coins. For example, USDT/ETH is a liquidity pair. Traders can swap between crypto-assets and stable coins based on market conditions. As the volatility of stablecoins is negligible, it offers a safe option for traders to manage the high volatility of crypto tokens and assets by swapping them with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                •	As a result, decentralized liquidity exchanges enable companies to launch a token and access immediate liquidity.

                <p className="lead">
                In an IDO, the token is issued via decentralized liquidity exchanges, such as Uniswap, Bancor, or Binance. The first-ever IDO was hosted by Binance DEX. According to them, this fundraising method enables protocols available for traders without being controlled by others.
